# random-walker-2
Updated version of random walker

This version of the random walker stores the position of each 'dig' in an array and then renders them to screen once a second, rather than ask the program to loop through a bunch of calls to rect in every draw loop.

It will also prevent the walker from digging out areas off screen.
